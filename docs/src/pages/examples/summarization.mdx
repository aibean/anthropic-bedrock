## Response

```markdown
Here is a summary of the key points from the text:

- Amazon announced a new service called Amazon Bedrock that provides API access to large language models from AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon.

- Bedrock aims to democratize access to generative AI models and make it easy for developers to build applications using these models.

- Bedrock offers text and image models including Amazon's own Titan models. It provides a serverless experience so developers can easily find, customize, integrate, and deploy models without managing infrastructure.

- Bedrock allows developers to leverage other AWS services like SageMaker to test models and manage them at scale.

- Overall, Bedrock simplifies access to a range of powerful AI models for developers to build generative AI applications.
