# Get Started

`bedrock-anthropic` is a python library for interacting with Anthropic's models on AWS Bedrock. It makes it really easy to use Anthropic's models in your application.

## Installation

Install `bedrock-anthropic` using pip.

```bash
pip install bedrock-anthropic
```

## Authentication

    This is the preferred way to use this SDK. Learn more about how you can get your access key and secrey key [here](/python/client).

    ```python copy
    import os
    from bedrock_anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

    anthropic = AnthropicBedrock(
        access_key=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY"),
        secret_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_KEY"),
        region=os.getenv("AWS_REGION")
    )
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
    In this method, your credentials are already provided by the AWS CLI. Read more about it [here](/python/client).

    ```python copy
    from bedrock_anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

    anthropic = AnthropicBedrock()
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
    In the case that your company has a specific role or seperate IAM Role to access Bedrock, you can specify the assume role manually. You must also ensure that the user has the permissions to [assume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) such role.

    ```python copy
    from bedrock_anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

    anthropic = AnthropicBedrock(
        assumed_role = os.getenv("AWS_ASSUMED_ROLE")
    )
    ```

    _This assumes you have the AWS CLI setup._
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Done!

You are all set to use the `bedrock-anthropic` Python SDK!

```python
import os
from bedrock_anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

anthropic = AnthropicBedrock(
    access_key=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY"),
    secret_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_KEY"),
    region=os.getenv("REGION")
)

completion = anthropic.Completion.create(
    model="anthropic.claude-v2",
    prompt="In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?",
)

print(completion["completion"])
```
